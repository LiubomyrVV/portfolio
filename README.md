About Me:

I am a self-taught Front End Developer with one year of experience, currently enrolled in an evening high school program. I dedicate all my free time to programming and am available to work on Saturdays and Sundays. My initial experience was with pure JavaScript, and I have since advanced to using React and TypeScript. I have collaborated in two team projects, continuously expanding my skill set, handling various frontend tasks, and occasionally writing simple backend code.

I am passionate about IT, constantly learning new technologies, and striving to improve as a specialist. I am hardworking, quick at solving technical problems, enjoy teamwork, and am always ready for new challenges.
